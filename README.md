# quizdroid2
Homework requirement:

in this part, switch from using Activities to Fragments


Stories:

As a developer, the "topic overview", "question" and "answer" pages should be merged into a single Activity, using Fragments to swap between the question UI and the answer UI. This means, then, that there will be only two Activities in the entire system: the list of topics at the front of the application, and the multi-use activity that serves for the topic overview, the question, and answer pages.
 
Homework Grading:

All your code should be in a GitHub repo under your account
repo should be called 'quizdroid'
repo should contain all necessary build artifacts
include a directory called "screenshots", including:
screenshot of app running on emulator
pic or screenshot or movie of app running on a device
We will clone and build it from the GH repo
5 points, one for each satisfied story from the previous (pt1) version of the assignment refactored to use fragments
